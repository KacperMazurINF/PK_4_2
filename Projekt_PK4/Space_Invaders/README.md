## Spaceship shooter arcade style game

This project is inspired by a book I read about Python. It features free movement of the ship in every direction, shooting bullets, moving targets, difficulty increase and stat tracking.

For movement we use arrow keys, for shooting spacebar, if we want to quit we press Q, everything else is done by the program. Each cleared level increses the speed of targets, so the game does not become monotone.

Everything has its own class for easier readability and accessibility.
